# Python Compression Program

## Overview

The program allows users to compress files and folders into various compressed file types, such as `.zip`, `.tar`, and `.tgz`. The program prompts users to select the folder to compress, choose the desired compression type, and then compresses the selected folder accordingly. In the case of `.zip` compression, the resulting file is named "name_of_the_folder_date_month_year.zip".
